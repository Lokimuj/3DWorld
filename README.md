# 3DWorld

A small programming and math exercise I gave myself. All the mathematical concepts/equations I used in my code were derived/rederived or from memory, I looked up nothing.

This is a basic 3D engine made using java awt, with simple lighting. Currently when CodeTest.java is run, a rotating tetrahedron with randomly colored faces moves away from the camera slowly.
